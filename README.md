# business-finder-vue

## Intro
This project was an experiment with [Vue](http://vuejs.org), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) and [Vuetify](http://vuetifyjs.com).

The initial goal was develop a client side interface to CRUD listings, events and deals.

The api was mocked using promises and setTimeout to emulate the request delay.
